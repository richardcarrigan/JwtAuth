        <p>
          The purpose of this project is to provide the simplest possible
          example of handling JWT authentication, using as many "best practices"
          as possible. I'm not a security expert, which is why I've created this
          project as a sandbox, so I don't recommend using this 'as-is' for your
          production apps. Instead, make sure you understand the features that
          this app showcases and make sure that you're implementing them as
          necessary into your apps.
